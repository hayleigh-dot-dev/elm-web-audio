# Building These Examples

I use `parcel-bundler` for build these projects, so make sure you have that installed.
I like to install it globally:

```npm i -g parcel-bundler```

Change into this directory and just run:

```parcel simple/index.html``` or ```parcel advanced/index.html```

Then go to [`localhost:1234`](localhost:1234) and check it out!
